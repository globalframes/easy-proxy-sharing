# easy-proxy-sharing
Sharing of proxy files with GitHub and SyncThing

## Goal
Easy sharing of video content files in a decentralized and permissionless manner.

## About
To facilitate decentralization of video editing some form of content sharing has to be established. Due to the size of video files - some form of proxy workflow has to be established. 

**The proxy workflow used (in terms of software) should be documented when sharing the files.**

### Syncthing
Synthing is a very easy to set-up personal cloud service. It enables users to securely share folders from their computers and we can use that mechanic to easily share our video files in a broad manner, without having to run **extra server infrastructure**.

### GitHub
Because Syncthing can share folders securely through a public key, we can just add this public key to a website - in this case we will use GitHub Pages for ease of editability and facilitation of contributors.
